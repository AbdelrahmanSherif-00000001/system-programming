this is a file manager based on system calls in C, I built 2 versions, the second is more optimized and have edit feature<br>
at the moment, it can create/delete/open/edit a file ,BUT edit need to be enhanced <br>
I will work to enhance edit and make it more user-friendly and also add GUI.

<br>to compile: gcc file_manipulator.c -o v 
<br>to run: ./v
